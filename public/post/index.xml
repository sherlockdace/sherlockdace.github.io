      <description>As large language models (LLMs) continue to expand in size and intricacy, mitigating their computational and energy demands has emerged as a pivotal challenge. Quantization has surfaced as a prominent approach, involving the reduction of parameter precision in models to lower bit formats. For instance, numerous methodologies truncate parameters from the conventional 16-bit floating point (FP16) or 32-bit floating point (FP32) to diminished bit formats such as 8-bit or 4-bit.</description>

      <description>Background Simplex Method Interior-Point Method ALM and ADMM PDHG Background One fundamental question in the field of optimization is how to solve linear programming (LP) problems. Typically, there are two well-known frameworks, namely the Simplex Method and the Interior-Point Method, that have been proposed to tackle LP problems.&#xA;However, when it comes to solving large-scale problems with millions (even billions) of variables and constraints, both the Simplex Method and the Interior-Point Method may not be practical enough.</description>
