      <description>One fundamental question in the field of optimization is how to solve linear programming (LP) problems. Typically, there are two well-known frameworks, namely the Simplex Method and the Interior-Point Method, that have been proposed to tackle LP problems.&#xA;However, when it comes to solving large-scale problems with millions (even billions) of variables and constraints, both the Simplex Method and the Interior-Point Method may not be practical enough. Their efficiency tends to decrease significantly under such circumstances.</description>
